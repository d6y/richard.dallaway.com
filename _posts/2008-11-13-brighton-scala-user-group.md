Last night was the Brighton Scala User Group pub [meet up][]. For the
record the conversation covered:

-   The Scala Plugin for Eclipse, how it runs on the Mac, how it lives with Maven.
-   The power of [Aspect Orientated Programming][] for fixing other people's code.
-   [NIO][].
-   The JVM language summit, and [photos taken][].
-   Neil Gafter, Closures In Java, what we think NG thinks of Scala.
-   Refinements, a.k.a. duck typing (see section 3.2.7 and specifically example 3.2.4 on page 22 of the [Language Spec][]).
-   Invoke dynamic, tail recursion, catching multiple exceptions.
-   Is there a JSR for Java 7?
-   Java 7, do we care about Java language features now? We do care about the JVM.
-   Languages on the JVM with parity performance with Java: Scala, Clojure.
-   Idioms.
-   Mac keyboards as a way for Apple to lock in users.
-   What Scala language features Java developers like.
-   Using existing web frameworks other than Lift with Scala.
-   Focal length, depth of field.
-   Sun's war chest.
-   The Groovy/Grails/Spring Source deal.
-   Return early v. one and only one return.
-   Language features for nicely dealing with instanceOf tests.
-   Interesting corner-cases of the type system.
-   What *is* it about Scala that's so attractive? What problems is
    Scala solving?

The [next event][] will be 17 December 2008.
