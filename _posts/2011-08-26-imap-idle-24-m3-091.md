-   Improvements for temporary network failure. We now monitor and disconnect if IDLEing for more than 30 minutes, as a way to catch socket errors hidden by IDLE.
-   If disconnected from the IMAP server, we now request all waiting messages on a reconnect.
-   Switched to SBT 0.10.1.
-   Now also publishing source and javadoc into the repository.

This version is available for Lift 2.4-M3 for Scala 2.8.1 and 2.9.0-1.

The [IMAP IDLE external Lift Module][] provides push-like email
facilities so your Lift web application can be notified when email
arrives.

Use in your `Boot` like this:

    ImapIdle.init { m: javax.mail.Message =>
      println("You've got mail: "+EmailUtils.dump(m))
      true // delete the email on the server
    }
