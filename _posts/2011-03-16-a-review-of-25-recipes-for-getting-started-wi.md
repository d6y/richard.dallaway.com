*25 Recipes for Getting Started with R, by Paul Teetor. Published
O'Reilly Media, Jan 2011.*

**Summary**

Need to "do stats"?  This text is a great way to get a hands-on tour of
how to use R, to find out if you want to learn more.

**Review**

From time to time I need to plot some data, compute correlations... that
kind of thing.  Doing anything like that in a spreadsheet is a pain for
me, so I'm on the lookout for a stats framework or tool I can live with.
 R ([http://www.r-project.org/][]) could be that tool. 

You can work through this 58 page book, trying out the examples, in one
session.  You probably won't improve your understanding of statistics at
the end of that, but you will get a feeling of what working with R would
be like.

For the time I invested in exploring R, I gained a lot of out using this
book.  Worth sitting down with if you're in a similar position to me.
Recommended.
