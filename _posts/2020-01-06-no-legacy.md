I'm wrangling some job automation via email, again. I decided to do this in Rust, although part of me was wondering why bother? 

<!-- break -->

I've already written something close enough in Scala, using a tried and tested Java library that I know well enough to dig myself out of most holes.  To add to the doubt,  the Rust parsing library has this warning in the README:

> "This is written by a newbie Rust programmer, so code may be non-idiomatic or suboptimal."

Fair enough. I still gave it a go.
It's a small amount of code, and the learning will be useful.

Perhaps under the hood the library lacking (I've not looked; I don't know). But from a user point of view, it's written the way I need it to be.  I mean, it uses `Option` to signal values that might be missing; it uses `Result` to type errors, using a nice ADT. I can `map` and `and_then` over values.

I assume that's the benefit of Rust having no real legacy. It's not a platform from a time when nulls and exception throwing was the norm. It means a self-declared newbie is led by idiom to build a library that's reasonable to use.

Long may it last.
