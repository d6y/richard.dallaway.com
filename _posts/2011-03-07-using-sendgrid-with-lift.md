If you want to send email from your [Lift][] app using [SendGrid][] you
need to do two things: set an authenticator and enable the javax.mail
authentication flag. That second part isn't obvious.

**Step by step...**

Assuming your Lift props file contains the following:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3072157.js"> </script>

In Boot you need to set the authenticator:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3072181.js"> </script>
Â 
And you're done.  The regular `Mailer` class will now use SendGrid.
