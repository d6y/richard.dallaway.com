[John][] at the [London Scala User Group][] ran "[LSug Workshop: Up-close and personal with SBT][]" yesterday at [Skillsmatter][].  It
was a kind of mini-unconference, and I contributed an introduction to
SBT.  The video above is the first half of a screen recording I made,
and it [continues into part 2 on Youtube][].

I learnt a lot from the evening on how others use SBT, and from [Maciej Matyjas][] talk on [giter8][] and plugins (including what looks like a
wonderful [plugin to Posterous][]). [Phil Wills][] showed us how to
create a SBT plugin, and that doesn't look too scary now.

Skillsmatter should post [video of the evening][] at some point, and
Chris Tuner [live blogged][] the event.
