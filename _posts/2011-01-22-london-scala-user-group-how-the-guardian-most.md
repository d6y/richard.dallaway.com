[Graham Tackley][] spoke at a packed [LSUG][] about how
[guardian.co.uk][] implemented their first Scala project, [the content
API][].  It's well worth [watching the video][] to see the timeline of
how the team switched their brains from Java to Scala (what the team
initially liked, what they liked after a year, [grokking flatMap][],
tools, and more).  

The result after the transition: more fun, better code, more productive
and happier developers.  Regarding the cost of switching, the comment
from the team during the Q&A was: there's a learning curve to Scala, but
providing you have someone to lead the way, the switch doesn't
materially effect delivery in the first three months, and post three
months the team becomes more productive.

Go watch that video, and if you're close by, [sign up][] to the London
Scala User Group.  I had a sneak peek at some of the talks for 2011, and
there are some great ones in there.
