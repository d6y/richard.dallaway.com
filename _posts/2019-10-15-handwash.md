I like to avoid colds and other nasties,
so inspired by [Global Handwashing Day][ghd],
I've gathered together links and notes on handwashing and related subjects.

# The basics

Wash your hand properly:
regular soap and water,
all parts of the hand and wrist,
and dry with a paper towel. 
The soap and mechanical action of washing rips a virus apart and removes bacteria.
You don't need anything else.

There are plenty of step-by-step guides and videos:

- [How to wash your hands](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/best-way-to-wash-your-hands/), NHS, 18 Oct 2019.

- Evans, E. W., [Most people don’t wash their hands properly – here’s how it should be done](https://theconversation.com/most-people-dont-wash-their-hands-properly-heres-how-it-should-be-done-125330), _The Conversation_, 15 Oct 2019.

- [NHS Guide to Handwashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAwS0UslEDs) (video), 10 Feb 2012.

You can dry your hands with just one piece of paper:

# Resist touching your face and eyes

Touching your mouth, nose or eyes is a good way to self contaminate yourself.
Resist it.

> "A behavioral study of medical students at the University of New South Wales found that of the 26 participants, students touched their face an average of 23 times per hour and 44 percent of the time it was in contact with a mucous membrane."

# Hand sanitizers

Prefer hand washing and avoiding touching your face. However:

> "If you touch your face (as most of us do), you might like to use a hand rub after leaving the train or bus, as hand hygiene can reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses by 20% and by 30% for gastrointestinal infections."

Source: [Health Check: should we be using alcohol-based hand sanitisers?](https://theconversation.com/health-check-should-we-be-using-alcohol-based-hand-sanitisers-62037), _The Conversation_, 1 Aug 2016.

There's a fun discussion of hand sanitizers on _The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread?_ podcast, the [Winter bugs: Hand sanitisers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p070qyks) episode from 13 Feb 2019.
My take-away from that episode was to avoid antibacterial (non-alcohol) hand sanitisers due to the risk of antibiotic resistance. Plus, they typically come in a plastic container, so there's that too.

So:

> "If soap and water are not unavailable, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol. Alcohols have a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity and are less selective for bacterial resistance compared to other antibacterial chemicals."

# Nasal sprays

Maybe: Nasal sprays create a hostile (acidic) environment in your nose.

No huge studies yet, but this is a plausible mechanism to give you protection from someone who has just sneezed near you.
However, it's not clear how long the effect lasts.

# Flu vaccination

Sure.

> "The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to the end of November."

# Surgical masks

No. Partly because they are impractical, as people won't wear them properly.

- [Can surgical masks protect you from getting the flu?](https://theconversation.com/can-surgical-masks-protect-you-from-getting-the-flu-125023), _The Conversation_, 17 Oct 2019.

_Update March 2020:_ In light of the Coronavirus, _The Guardian_ has commented:

> "If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference."

Source: [Yes, it is worse than the flu: busting the coronavirus myths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/yes-worse-than-flu-busting-coronavirus-myths-covid-19), _The Guardian_, 3 March 2020, 10:50 GMT.

The newspaper has also published a [useful video on face masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gASCBhA2bE4seful), describing the different kinds, the problems, and alternatives. 

# Disinfect your phone screen

I'm not sure about this one yet.

It is the case that viruses and bacterial live on phones,
but it's unclear how bad the transmissions is from the phone
or what the clearing schedule should be.

I'm more thinking of not taking my phone out as much.

However, we do have one source suggesting using 
a wipe on your phone twice a day (perhaps before lunch and then before dinner).

> "A recently published study estimates that viruses like COVID-19 may be able to persist for up to nine days on smooth glass and plastic surfaces, like a mobile phone screen."

# Vitamins

In the UK, take vitamin D supplement in the autumn and winter. 

See: [Vitamin D](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/), NHS, 3 Mar 2017.

Regarding other vitamins:

> "Regular ingestion of vitamin C had no effect on common cold incidence in the ordinary population, based on 29 trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants"

...although it can reduce the duration,
but this is only by 8% so not worth taking a vitamin C supplement every day for this.

Source: [Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold](https://www.cochrane.org/CD000980/ARI_vitamin-c-for-preventing-and-treating-the-common-cold), Cochrane, Jan 2013.

# If you do get a cold...

Still no conclusive effect if you take vitamin C therapeutically (when you have a cold). Probably nothing much going on.

Take 75 mg to 100 mg zinc when you are ill (obviously, along with everything else in this post, your medical circumstances may be different).
Can reduce the duration of a cold by a third (maybe 2 days).

Has to take effect at the back of your throat, so go for a lozenge (ionic zinc). Avoid (the often added) citric acid, tartaric acid, fats, vitamin C as these _nullify the effect of the zinc_!.
