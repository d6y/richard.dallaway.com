I have my ticket. [How about you?][]  It's £150 at the moment.

What we're looking at here is a two day unconference, meaning we get a chance to learn about things we're interested in by figuring it out on the day, talking to people, rather than being lectured at.  I thoroughly
enjoyed the Scala Lift Off last year in San Francisco, so I'm looking
forward to the London one.  Especially as it close by, rather than
[8,720km][] away.
