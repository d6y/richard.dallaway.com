  Resources for learning Rust

The other day I was asked to recommend resources for learning the Rust programming language. Here’s what I came up with.

<!-- break -->

How do you like to learn?

- If you want to type-it-in-the-browser, you have [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) (free).

- To follow along with a book, using your favourite [editor](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools): [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is “the book” (free, or you can purchase a physical copy).

- If you want video, try [Rust in Motion](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/rust-in-motion) (paid) or the [Rust channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA).

- For those working in Jupyter (maybe you love the [science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2)?) there’s the [EvCxR Jupyter Kernel](https://github.com/google/evcxr). That won’t teach you Rust, but it’ll give you a familiar environment.

- If you prefer to work through projects:
	- [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) (paid) seems to have a project in every chapter.
	- If you’re into Rust for the WASM, there’s the [Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) book (free) and [Programming WebAssembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust/) (paid).
	- For bare-metal programming: [The Embedded Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/) (free).
		 
Then there are (free) challenges like [Exercism](https://exercism.io), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), or [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

Two specific topics are worth a look once you’re coding: [The Little Book of Rust Macros](https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/README.html) (free; thank you, [Andrea](https://www.roundcrisis.com/), for sharing this with me) and the work-in-progress [Asynchronous Programming in Rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/01_chapter.html) book (free).

If you want the nitty-gritty you have the (incomplete) [Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/index.html), and as a back up to that [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html).

Finally, I have my own list of [Rust principles](https://richard.dallaway.com/2020/05/04/rust-principles.html) as a quick reminder of the key concepts.
