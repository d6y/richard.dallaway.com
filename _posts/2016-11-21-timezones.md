The podcast makes ten points:


1. Make it fair --- Inevitably someone will be getting up early or working late. Don't let it just be one team all the time. Share the pain around.
2. Organize well --- Instead of going from East to West, try organizing from North to South. Even though there's great distance, timezones are close. If you can, don't overlap remote teams. Have the teams work on separate problems, with overlap when convenient.
3. Prioritize overlap time ---  When you have 1 or 2 hours of overlap, prioritize the time together. That's the time for meetings, and make it video for bonding.
4. Talk in one timezone --- This is an item from the Team Agreement episode (42). Pick a timezone, and everyone is responsible for converting themselves. This minimizes confusion.
5. Use a shared calendar --- This also helps minimize mistakes with scheduling.
6. Record meetings --- Not everyone can make every meeting. Record them. Useful to see and hear the conversation, and feel like part of the team even though you're not there.
7. Standup tools --- If you can't overlap, use tools to stand up asynchronously.  E.g., [Standup bot](https://standupbot.com/) (but also [I Done This](https://beta.idonethis.com)).
8. Double check your times --- You get timezones wrong. Get in the habit of double checking. Use: [The Time Zone Converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/), [World Time Buddy](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/), and [World timezone](http://www.worldtimezone.com/).
9. Think in multiple timezones --- Be aware with your team timezones. You're starting your day, but that might be dinner for others. Try: [Timezone.io](https://timezone.io/) or [Every Timezone](http://everytimezone.com/).
10. Meet face to face --- Every once in a while, go and meet up. Rebuild the human connection.
