Thanks to [Ewan Silver][] and others for organizing the [Next Net][]
meet up. It's sort of a London Jini Group, but more general: a gathering
of people interested in distributed (utility computing, grid computing,
massively scalable, resilient) systems.

I unfortunately missed a large chunk of [Dan Creswell][]'s [presentation on Utility Computing with Amazon EC2][]. What I could figure out
rekindled my interest in these technologies.

For example: On my way over to the meeting I was wondering about how
best to distribute database load [somehow][] or [other][]. When I walked
into the meeting, the presentation was discussing doing-away with things
like relational databases to obtain big scalability, and shifting
mindsets away from Java EE. Ah. So think different.

Why would you bother? I think I'm finally starting to get utility
computing. If you've worked in an environment where budgets for hardware
involve a lot of hoop-jumping, it suddenly makes sense to be able to
call on a dynamic network of resources at the moment you need it. What's
more, it's looking like it's [cheap][]. There's effort in building
systems that take advantage of that kind of an environment, but if the
cost savings are there, the pressure will come to build them that way.

It's interesting stuff, and now I have a larger-than-usual reading list
as a result: [MapReduce][], [Bigtable][], [Chubby][], [Google File System][], [Hadoop][] the [10th Jini Community Meeting][] papers and the Amazon [Web Services Developer Connection][] docs.

The next Next Net will be Thur 18 Jan 2007 at Brunel.
