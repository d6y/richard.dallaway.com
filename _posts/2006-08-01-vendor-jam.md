Try to catch [Just a Minute][] on the radio/internet sometime. It's a
[long-running][] panel game. A player of the game will try to talk on a
subject for 60 seconds without the other participants spotting
hesitation, deviation or repetition.

I think this could be the magic formula for making vendor presentations
at conferences more interesting. A chairman introduces a subject (SOA,
web services, RoI, ...) and one of the contestants starts taking
until... [bzzz][]... an opponent spots one of the three violations. If
the challenge is correct, they get points and take on the topic for the
remaining time. The winner gets to give out t-shirts, CDs or give
closing remarks or something.
