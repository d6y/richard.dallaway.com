There's something right about [£5 App][] running a demo/game/fun
[event][] as the [Xmas special][]. I mean, how does this sound: I turn
up at [The Werks][], icy cold, to be handed a lovely hot mulled wine by
the [Ribot][]s, directed towards the mince pies, and then entertained
with a range of funky technology stuff. Mmm.

This evening there were talks and demos covering: collaborative
interactive fiction (a.k.a., group-generated text adventure), namely
[Spaceship][]; [Emily][] demoing robot sumo; mobile phone [Lightsaber dueling][] (no, not with the iPhone); eye controlled Pong, from [Ben Rubinstein][]. All excellent.

Maybe it's because of the fun we had the previous day at the Flash [Big Screen Bonanza][], or perhaps it's because I'd been noodling with
[JavaFX][], but I found [Seb][]'s Flash 3D and augmented reality demos great fun.

I'd say, of the evening, the biggest wow! was when Seb showed us the
[augmented reality stuff][]; and the biggest round of applause of the
night was when he said "hey, all I've done is download it and compile
it" :-)

But you don't even need to do that. From that last link, if you print
out [the PDF symbol][], click the start button (and right click and
select "USB camera" in settings, but you may not have to do that), and
hold up the symbol you can try it yourself. It's not bad, eh?

The underlying tech seems to be from the C [ARToolKit][], which is
available under [the GPL and other licenses][]. Given that the
documentation touches on support for SGI/Irix and VRML I think it must
have a pretty robust [history][].

There's some mention of a Java bindings for it, but after a bit of
digging it turns out there's a [pure Java 6 port][], and from what I can
understand a version from the same author for the Android platform. I've
not tried them; I've no idea if they work.

If you're interested in this area, there's documentation on [how ARToolKit works][].
