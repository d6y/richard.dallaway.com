For the impatient: impressive Seam and JRuby/NetBeans demos; JavaFX doesn't look that crazy after all; performance improvements show promise; quality of the talks were consistently high and better than I recall from previous years; need to look at Groovy and Grails more.

I don't like to make too much fuss about these events, but when I go
into the first keynote on the first day of JavaOne, look around and see
the size of the place (space for just 15,000 attendees [this year][]),
look at the huge screens on stage, with [DJ Anon][] doing her thing, and
then the big numbers come out: 6 million developers, 2 billion mobile
devices, 11 million TVs, Java on 91% of desktops. I have to admit to
being somewhat awed by the event. They do a good show. It's not Steve
Jobs, but it's pretty good.

The big announcement this year was **JavaFX**. This is a blanket term
covering authoring tools for "content professionals", an environment for
mobile and a scripting language. The authoring tools don't exist yet.
**JavaFX Script** does, and used to be called F3â€”a technology I've
previously described as "nuts". We first heard about F3 at the London
Sun Tech Days, and we couldn't understand why it existed when SVG looked
to do the same thing in a similar way.

This time, we had [Chris Oliver][], the author of the language, on hand
to explain it. His talk kicked off by asking why Java applications
looked so different to Flash applications. Java has the capability to
produce all the effects you see in Flash, but they're harder to get at.
Step in JavaFX Script which is component scripting of Java 2D and Swing.

And why not SVG? Well, there are lots of similarities between SVG and
JavaFX Script (indeed, there's a [converter][]), but the dynamic stuff
in SVG is a pain. That's something I can confirm from experience.

In JavaFX Script you can do the dynamic stuff with Java (naturally), but
the language also has a data binding feature ([functional reactive
programming][], apparently). As I understood it, elements of the view
are bound to elements of the model. This means there's no listening code
to write: the model changes, the view updates. There are demos,
downloads and documentation over at [openjfx.org][].

So maybe not so nuts after all. To get that into the browser, though,
needs some work. Right now you need to add about 700k to an applet
download. The Java Plugin needs some work to make this better (but see
the demos over at [swinglabs.org][]; I must get round to trying out
[Iris][]). Chris Oliver wasn't taking questions on this area. In fact,
we had the impression that he had perhaps been under a bit of pressure
recently: after all, the technology had a different name a month or so
ago, was a side demo at London Tech Days, and now was pushed way up the
conference agenda.

In related news, there is going to be a **consumer JVM**, presumably
targeting RIA, scheduled for early 2008. The focus is on performance,
both runtime and download time. There's also work going on to modularize
Java (super packages in development terms; super JARs in deployment
terms).

The **JavaFX Mobile** [announcement][] is that Sun have a complete
mobile stack which is being offered to OEMs: it's the SavaJe technology
on top of Linux. We saw a demo running on a Neo1973, the SavaJe device,
and a Nokia N800. Meh... we'll see what comes of it.

While on the subject of mobile, just two notes: I was disappointed to
see only one prototype MSA device (SE [Z50i][]), given that [MSA][] has
been talked about for a long time; but I had a look at the [Nokia 6110
Navigator][], and that has a great deal of promise as a phone for
location, although no WLAN and only a single processor.

Anyway, JavaFX Mobile is being placed on the cusp between ME and SE:

Probably the other headline news was the support for Ruby and Rails via
the **JRuby** implementation. If you're developing in Ruby (and/or using
Rails), you'll want to check out the Toy Show Part 2 from the [Friday
keynote][] or take a look at one of the [online demos][]. Either way,
you should try out [NetBeans 6][].

Going into the conference I was wondering which scripting language I
should be putting effort into: Ruby or **Groovy**. Both look to be very
capable. After attending the [Groovy/Grails One Meet-up][], and gaining
some confidence from hearing the people behind the language, I think
that Groovy might be more useful to me. It has the edge on integration
with Java right now. What I didn't get was an intro to [Grails][].
Something I'll have to try out.

Another thing that demands attention is **GWT**. It has a reasonable
widget set, fast client development, they've worked on cross-browser and
performance issues and browser memory leak issues. Paul [blazed the
trail][], and we managed to hack on a GWT app for a while, getting it
all working, including client-to-server serialization. I've not seen
anything that puts me off it yet. (Interesting to hear from Google that
they think a page load time of 300ms is the threshold for users to be
happy. That's the start up time they target.)

Gavin King's **Seam** demo was just perfect for getting a feel for what
[Seam][] is about. The demo nicely contrasted the assumption that EJB is
heavy by having a container that starts up in the IDE in less than a
second. He then continued by developing a Seam web application without
the need to restart the container once. Another technology worth
checking out.

From other sessions...

-   The [Hibernate integration with Lucene][] looks like a no-brainer if
you need to add text search to an application.
-   The API for restful web services looks good. I'll take another look
when they finish the [spec][].
-   I was at a session on deploying and scaling massive digital archive
repositories. It turned out to be a vendor pitch to go buy a
[StorageTek 5800][], but it was interesting to learn about the APIs
they are building into the disk storage, with hints about this
becoming an open standard. Forget files. (This could be related to
[Project Honeycomb][].)
-   NASDAQ do 100k transactions/second on the Java platform. They're
looking to use [Java Real Time][]. Presumably for predictability.
-   Mark Harriman of Ericsson said they're basing their IMS products on
Glassfish. Possibly to be called the Sun Java System Communication
Application Server.
-   When running the Glassfish application server, you can write your
site in Ruby, Javascript, PHP and Java. Probably other languages
too, via the scripting plugin spec.
-   I understand that [JChav][] was mentioned in one session. Fantastic.
-   The only session I was disappointed with was a Jini one. While the
language has been changing and going forward, Jini seems (to an
outsider like me) relatively unchanged since the first version.
Right now to use Jini, you really need to want to use Jini.
-   The Neal Gafter presentation on closures for the languages was great
to sit through. Each time I hear about the proposal I understand a
little bit more about it.
-   The Effective Java Reloaded session (Josh Bloch again) was superb.
Note to self: need to understand wildcard capture in generics, and
remember that arrays and generics don't play so well together.

So: quite an emphasis on scripting, language changes and richer UIs.
