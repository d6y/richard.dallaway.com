A few weeks back [Miles][] emailed the [BrightArray group][] with a link
to Erik Meijer's Functional Programming Fundamentals lectures. You can
find them listed at channel9 tagged as [C9 Lectures][].

I'm not planning to [use Haskell for real][], but I wanted to pass the
links on because I'm finding the lectures really helpful for thinking
about software. Possibly for thinking in general.

Two practical points about the series: you don't have to install
Silverlight to watch them as there are links to other formats over on
the right of the page. And the slides can be found over [at Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell page][].

Oh, and don't forget to do the homework.
