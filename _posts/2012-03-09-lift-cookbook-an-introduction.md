I’m a fan of the format used by the [O’Reilly Cookbook][] series: a
problem statement, short solution, and then a discussion. Could this be
a useful way to capture nuggets of knowledge about the [Lift web framework][]?

The only way to find out is to try to write a few recipes, so I did that
last month and the result is up at
[cookbook.liftweb.net][] <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">[http://liftcookbook.spiralarm.cloudbees.net][] (yes,
we need a shorter URL)</span>.

There’s not a lot there yet, but the mechanism is now in place to create
more, and there’s the start of a structure to navigate around topics.

[Jono][] or I will tweet articles via [@LiftCookbook][], so that’ll be worth
following if you want to consume.

If you’re up for contributing, you’ll be happy to know the format is
easy: each page is a markdown file, which a build server  turns into
HTML via [Pamflet][].   There’s [a recipe for writing new recipes][],
but you can also [navigate the source][] and press “edit this file” to
make a quick change.

If you’re stuck on ideas for what to write, here are some suggestions:

-   there are plenty of questions on the Lift mailing list, usually followed up with great answers;
-   the many useful tips and tricks in the [Lift wiki][] that could be surfaced as problem/solutions recipes; and
-   I’ve sketched out  a few ideas as [issues on the project GitHub site][]—feel free to take one of those, and write it up. But there’s no need to the use GitHub’s issue tracker: just write what interests you anyway you want.

I’ve found writing recipes rewarding, and with your help we can grow
this to a useful resource.
