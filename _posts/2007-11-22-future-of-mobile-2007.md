What follows are the remarks or thoughts I noted down...

#### Consumers

-   Mobile phone users are not consumers, but creators. Phone calls,
text messages are made up of a create and consume pair. I've heard
this a great deal lately, especially in the context of the iPhone.
There's clearly some truth in it, but I wonder for how long: if my
phone has a music player in it, that's more consumption that
creation. If I'm browsing the web, that's consumption. If I'm
updating a social networking site from my phone, or uploading a
photo to Flickr, sure, that creating, but it's not unique to the
phone. Email and IM can also be a create and consume pair, and
that's something you can do on the desktop or the handset. I'm not
sure the whole [active v. passive consumers][] meme is terribly
useful.
-   Mobile's combination of location plus attention is a unique
advertising opportunity.

#### Content creation

-   "Vodafone UK and Novarra are breaking the mobile web". (See [TechCrunch][])
-   If you're anti One Web, Luca Passani's alternative to the W3C's
[Mobile Web Best Practices][] will be something you'll want to read:
[Global Authoring Practices for the Mobile Web][]
-   One Web is about [thematic consistency][]: "Ensure that content
provided by accessing a URI yields a thematically coherent
experience when accessed from different devices."
-   WURFL has 3,000 developers, and WALL (Wireless abstraction library -
a markup system to help automatically output the right kind of
markup for different devices) is going into a new version: WNG.
[Slides are available][] for that announcement.
-   .Mobi exists to "help the mobile web grow". The Device Description
Repository (DDR) [API][] is due in Dec 2007/Jan 2008, but isn't
based on [WURFL][]. The reason is that .mobi want to "add trust" and
"add industry" to the API, protecting companies against possible
royalty payments, and to provide confidence via a brand.
-   Google mobile search is currently terrible.

 

#### Mobile AJAX

-   Daniel Appelquist: Mobile Ajax will replace a class of application
currently written in Java, will reduce time to market, open up the
space to more developers, and result in more apps.
-   Challenges for mobile Ajax: access to device hardware, consequences
of privacy control, need for developer guidelines.
-   Charles McCathieNevile: [ECMAScript 4][] is a "proper programming
language", which might help reduce the amount of battery power that
Javascript consumes.

 

#### Android

There was lots of interest in Android.

-   It's a full-stack mobile solution, and open source. Based on Linux
2.6, plus a hardware spec, apps, and Java.
-   Android exists to promote openness, build a loyal developer base,
grow Google experience, and make handsets cheaper (software is 10%
of the handset BOM).
-   Each application is a separate Linux process, and all apps are equal
to the operating system. It will include two-way synchronization
(it'll be interesting to see how they've solved that problem).
-   Google are not worried about writing specs, and just wanted to write
it and get the code out.
-   The architecture does allow for support of MIDP applications
alongside Android applications. The Java implementation is
[Dalvik][], plus a collection of useful Java [packages][].
-   The claim is that the richer APIs provided give more control
compared to MIDP.
-   The system will be completely open source as soon as the first
handset shipped. This isn't expected until late 2008.

Some of presentations have started to [appear on SlideShare][].
