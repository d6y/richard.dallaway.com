I've been fortunate to be involved in a project that makes use of
[OpenAMF][]. Although I didn't spend a lot of time with the technology,
it is an interesting proposition.

AMF is the binary wire protocol for RPC calls between a [Flash][] player
and a server. OpenAMF is a Java-based open source implementation,
providing an alternative to Macromedia's Flash Remoting MX (and also
therefore providing a saving of something like Â£750 per CPU).

In practice, a Flash client makes calls to OpenAMF which sits inside a
servlet engine. It's the right way to do things (as of 2005): you end up
with an [SOA][]-based [rich internet application][].

The alternative is [AJAX][], and the [relationship][] between the two
competing technologies isn't clear. Both run in the browser, both are
based on JavaScript, and both make service-based requests. With [native SVG support][] on the way for Firefox, the similarities only increase.
But there are differences:

-   Tools: the Flash authoring editor is unrivaled, and although [open source or free tooling][] is available, it's nothing like the
editor. In the AJAX world there are no special tools needed.
-   Protocols: The "open" in OpenAMF refers to an open source
implementation, not the nature of AMF. Although the Flash file
format specification has been [released][], AMF has not. AJAX has
HTTP as a protocol, which can't be any more open, and builds on that
with either REST or SOAP services.
-   All-or-nothing: The impression is that if you're going to use Flash
you're going to use it for the whole project. AJAX is more amenable
to being mixed in, gradually, to existing "regular" web sites to add
dynamic features where they are needed the most. Less risk (or more,
depending on your point of view w.r.t Flash).
-   Mobile: SOA is, theoretically, client neutral. What is the protocol
to use for a mobile application? Although [Flash Lite][] is making
its way to mobile devices, the player omits support for remoting.
Macromedia have to fix that.

The conclusion I draw is that AJAX is the path of least resistance.
Assuming most people go that route, OpenAMF could still work as a bridge
between services for AJAX and services for Flash. Either way, it looks
like the demand for rich internet applications is going to continue to
grow, and SOA is going to stick around for a while.
