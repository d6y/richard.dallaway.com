A couple of weeks ago I was over at the [Google London Open Source Jam
3][], which was focused on Java. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it
turned out to be a series of five minute [talks][]. I'm not sure if
that's normal or not for the Open Source Jam series.

If I had to pick out one thing, I'd say take a look at the [closures
talk][]. I'd thought closures for Java was on it's way to being sorted,
but it turns out there are three proposals with pros and cons:

-   [BGGA][] (Bracha, Gafter, Gosling, Ahe)
-   [CICE][] (Concise Inner Class Expressions)
-   [FCM][] (First Class Method)

So more stuff to read and think about, then.

A really good evening of listening and chatting to some good people, so
thanks to those behind it. I think most people were weirded by
attending an open source jam and signing an NDA :-/ But let's face it,
no-one was going to not sign.
