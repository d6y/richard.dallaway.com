The BBC were at [etech this year][] describing some of the funky mobile
things they're getting up to. The ten hour takeover, for example.

The approach [we're][] taking with our messaging services looks to be
very similar to the approach the BBC are using. This is a nice
reassurance given that the BBC team have to [deal with][] breakfast
radio stars who get their audience to text in 14,000 message at once.

You can get the [audio on-line][], but you'll also want the
[presentation (7M PDF)][] to look at. It's great work, and well
presented.
