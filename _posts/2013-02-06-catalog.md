If you need to [resolve DTDs locally](/dtds) with the `scala.xml` parser, you should provide a `resolveEntity` to the `XMLLoader` adapter:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/d6y/4721661.js"></script>

This works out because `NoBindingFactoryAdapter` ultimately extends `org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler`, and this gives you the default no-op implementations of `EntityResolver`, `DTDHandler`, `ContentHandler` and `ErrorHandler`.

I figured this out from [related questions and answers on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1096285/is-scala-java-not-respecting-w3-excess-dtd-traffic-specs/1099921#1099921).
