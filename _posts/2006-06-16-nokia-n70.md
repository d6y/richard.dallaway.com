It'd been a long time since I'd used a Nokia handset, so I decided to
spend a whileâ€”--pretty much the last 12 months in fact---with a Series 60
[Nokia N70][]. I now need to get this off my chest: I hate this handset,
and I just don't like Series 60.

I'm starting to wonder if Sony Ericsson have re-wired my brain away from
the Nokia UI.

I quite liked Series 40, and it's still highly usable despite often
looking dated. And I've really tried to get into Series 60, but none of
the [Smartphone Hacks][] have helped, and none of the applications
(including [Lifeblog][]) and none of the 3G features (like mobile TV)
make it worth the pain.

The handset itself is actually pretty feature-full (2 megapixel camera,
3G, bluetooth etc...), but it runs too slowly for my liking. Writing
messages is slow and clunky; making phone calls from the address book is
overly awkward, and the functioning of the navigation keys next to the
big red hang-up button means you will quit an application by accident at
some point. I challenge you to use voice dialing without accidently
calling someone random from your address book.

At least the N70 syncs well with iSync, once you know the [magic
incantations][]. I'm being pushed into the arms of other handset
manufacturers....

Thank you for listening. That was therapeutic for me.
