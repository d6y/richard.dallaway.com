[The Economist daily briefing](https://www.economist.com/espresso) highlighted the work of [Dr Edith Widder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Widder), who has been recording giant squid.

[Her lab’s paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063721000777#!) gives the context:

> The legend of the “kraken” has captivated humans for millennia, yet our knowledge of the large deep-sea cephalopods that inspired this myth remains limited.

They have some great hardware to figure out what's going on. 
The remote camera system can extend 2 km down into the ocean, and record video for 48 hours. 
The figures in the paper are wonderful at explaining the setup:

Of course, it’s the stills of the squid that caught my eye. Figure 5, for example, estimates the arm of one squid to be 1.68 m long:

Before this, I wasn’t even sure if these animals were real or just exaggerations from sailors tales! I recommend watching [the 5 minutes of video that is “Supplementary Materials 6”.](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0967063721000777-mmc5.mp4) It’s slightly spooky, a little tense, but more in a James Cameron style then Ridley Scott.
