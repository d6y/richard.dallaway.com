[Monday][] was the first [Scala London User Group meeting][] that was
held around a keyboard. [Robert Rees][] arranged for a room, food, and
drink at [ThoughtWorks][], [Jamie Webb][] kindly gave an intro to Scala
talk, and Aaron Roth provided print outs of a [Scala for Java Programmers cheat sheet][]...and so we spent time working on the
[supermarket problem][].

I counted 19 people (of which 3 were Brighton based), of mixed abilty
(from functional people or Java people who had never touched Scala, all
the way to expert Scala-heads), and we had working, unit tested,
software by 10pm. Which—given that coding dojos [sound a bit mad][]—is
pretty good going.

Dojos are probably not going to be the way forward for this group, but I
think it did a good job as an ice-breaker: an inclusive activity; a task
that's not daunting, that anyone can have a crack at. I definitely
learnt stuff: testing using [Specs][], and need to understand the Scala
patterns, such as [Cake][] for dependency injection, and I have to stop
putting off looking at [Lift][]. Perhaps the most important thing for me
was to learn that the Eclipse Scala plugin is going to be able to do
mixed compilation of Java and Scala source in a project.

There was video of Jamies talk. I'll add a link if it's posted any
place.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">At the moment there's no web site for lsug but get in touch
