Most of my writing effort has gone into [The Lift Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029151.do), and one thing I missed was why you might be interested in Lift.

That's now fixed, via a three-part series of short posts over at [programming.oreilly.com](http://programming.oreilly.com/):

1. [The Appeal of the Lift Web Framework: Transforms and REST](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/07/the-appeal-of-the-lift-web-frameworks.html).

2. [A Birds-eye View with Lift: Organize and control content with the Lift web framework](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/07/a-birds-eye-view-with-lift.html).

3. [Squeaky Clean Ajax and Comet with Lift: Focus on application development, not the plumbing](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/07/squeaky-clean-ajax-and-comet-with-lift.html).

Hope you find the framework as fun and productive as I do.
