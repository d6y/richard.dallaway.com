This year the [London Future of Web Apps conference][] was held at the
[ExCel centre][]. Ah, the ExCel: a place that feels both sterile and
grimyâ€”something I thought only possible at airports and large shopping
centres.

The conference? It lacked substance, and was disappointing in that
respect. Still, that's not what it's all about: it's good to just take
some time away from the keyboard, and talk to people about "stuff".

I did enjoy...

-   [Matt Biddulph][] talking about "Dopplr: It's made of messages". A
good reminder that scale out is a lot easier if from day one you
plan for [N \> 1][]. I.e,. more than one web server, more than one
database, etc. I was interested to see that Dopplr use [ActiveMQ][]
for messaging; and we were pointed at [Enterprise Integration
Patterns][] as a book worth reading.
-   Blaine Cook & Joe Stump on "Languages don't scale". A nice set up by
insulting pretty much all programming languages, and then saying
that of course, it's not about the language, it's about I/O and the
architecture of scalability.
-   Blaine Cook's second presentation was on "Using Jabber to make
awesome web sites". In essence: polling sucks, use PubSub instead,
and in particular use the Jabber protocols to make things scale.
Well, [it doesn't solve all the problems][], but I think the
audience by now had taken the hint that messaging is useful.
-   I enjoyed the TechCrunch Pitch! event, in which five start ups
pitched their ideas, Dragon's Den style. Except without any money
being involved. And related to that (in my mind) on the following
day was "Work/life balance or Blood, sweat and tears: Which is the
startup way?". This was [Tom Nixon][] arguing for some sense of
work/life balance, while '80s throwback [Jason Calacanis][] gave the
other side of the argument. He didn't actually use the phrase "greed
is good", but it was in the air. I liked that session; it was
strangely energizing.


Those were the highlights for me. You can [watch the presentations online][].
