The other day at the London Scala User Group I was asked about creating
charts and graphs in Lift.  The two ways that sprung to mind were to use
Flot and Google Charts, so I've posted [example source code for creating
a bar chart][] both ways.  I probably should have made them look the
same, but hey, it's just an example to hack with.

All the code that matters is in [one file][].
