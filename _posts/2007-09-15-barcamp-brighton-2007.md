Tick... I've now attended a BarCamp. I absolutely loved it: many topics + small groups = a great opportunity to learn and chat about [lots of stuff][].


Some of the stuff I managed to sit in on, included:

-   CSS Selectivity Snap. Earlier in the day I'd jotted a reminder:
"must learn more CSS properly", and then [Jon Linklater-Johnson][]
(pictured above, right) steps in with a fantastic crash course in
selectivity. Huge fun.
-   [Jay Caines-Gooby][] chatting about backups. Nice idea: grab a NAS
drive, stick Linux on it, and then schedule syncing to S3.
-   [QR (quick response)][] codes, from [Tristan Roddis][]. I didn't
know [QR codes][] were an ISO standard or that there were different
variants. I hope Tristan's laptop has recovered from the water spill
:-(
-   An enlightening presentation called "Take my wallet but don't hurt
my face: Teenagers & the social web" by Daniel Morris. Another
presentation I learned a hell of a lot from: teenagers don't use
mobile internet, don't send MMSs, and visit a bunch of web sites
I've never heard of (of course).
-   "Building a recommendation engine from tagged content": it was great
to see the inside of an application exposed in terms of how
[worldreviewer.com][] is handling user recommendations. They're
taking the tag cloud for users and for activities, and computing a
[dot product][] to get a measure. The problem is that if you want to
do this real-time the calculations get expensive quickly. The
solution being explored is to reduce the space to a fixed-size
vector (manually at the moment, but they're looking to do some form
of proper [feature extraction][]).
-   Matthew Somerville's [Is Cornwall Part of England?][] talk was
superb. Turns out Cornwall probably has a case for an independent
government, but best not to mention it. [Statutelaw.gov.uk][] looks
a fun place to spend a few hours.
-   Behaviour driven development (BDD), which is "TDD done well".
Appears to be a good way to structure and express unit tests, and I
need to go and check out [JDave][].

I spoke about Mac OS X Server, which is something no-one seems to use.
I'll maybe write up my presentation at some point.

The [hosts][] and sponsors were enormously generous, and the organizers
really pulled it all together well. Thank you, [Paul][],
[Matt][]...well, so many people seemed to be making it happen. Check out
the [blog][] and the [wiki][] to get an idea of how many people were
involved.

The one particular memory I have is, surprisingly, not of the [Champagne
jelly][]. It's of sitting in a presentation on a warm summer's night.
Through the window drifted sounds of the young and beautiful people of
Brighton starting their evening of partying, while inside a group of 10
or so geeks sat around discussing dating and how it could all be "fixed"
with a large and elaborate XML schema.
