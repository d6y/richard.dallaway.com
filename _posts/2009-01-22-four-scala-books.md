In addition to the completed and shipping [Programming in Scala][] book
from Artima, there are three others in the works:

-   [Programming Scala: Tackle Multi-Core Complexity on the Java Virtual Machine][] from Pragmatic Programmers
-   [Programming Scala][] from O'Reilly
-   [Beginning Scala][] from APress.

Great news.

If I'm going to be picky, I'd say I'm a little concerned all these look
like they are language books, rather than "activity books". What I mean
by that is there's no "Database Persistence using Scala" or "Building
Fast Web Sites Quickly with Scala" or "Asynchronous Messaging with
Scala"... you get the idea. Sure, you can just get on and use the Java
way, but the idiomatic Scala approach is what I'm looking for.
