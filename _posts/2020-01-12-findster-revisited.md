It's now been a few years of using the [Findster Duo] pet tracker,
and it's time to share a couple of tips for making the most of it.
They are: permanently attach the Findster to a collar; and start the app early in your walk.

# Recap

There have been no huge changes since [I first posted][post1] about Findster:

- It's still two units: one attaches to your dog and sends location information to a second unit that you carry with you; and  
- I still use Findster primarily as a back up in case the dog vanishes after some woodland creature.

# Lesson 1: Permanent attachment

What has changed is the way Findster connects to the collar.
The first lesson I want to share is about this.
I suggest you permanently connect the Findster to a collar.

The original Findster attached with velcro, which worked fine as long as you took the time to get it tight and secure. I didn't, and we lost that one somewhere down a rabbit warren.

The replacement came with a base plate that the Findster can slot into.
You'd attach this base plate to the collar using a loop of material.
It fastened with a pin (or stud) mechanism, as shown in their [support video][video].

That seemed to be pretty solid, but we lost that one in some undergrowth.
We searched for a good 15 minutes where FIndster directed us, but we couldn't spot it.
The third unit had changed to a kind of screw mechanism for attaching the base plate. 
That became loose very quickly, and I never trusted it.

What we've done is to buy a thin collar that would slide onto the base plate.
It's pretty tight and took some work with a needle to push it through, but
now we have a dedicated Findster collar.
When we go out, we clip that collar on.
I'm much more confident that this is not going to fall off.

# Lesson 2: Start the app early

The Findster app comes with all sorts of features that I don't use: 
leaderboard, reminders, sharing, paw counts, fences, subscription-based optional care package. 
All I use is the map and radar.
I only care about where my dog is it she goes out of sight.

If I'm in the middle of no-where, with limited mobile signal strength,
it seems to take a while for the app to start. 
I'm not sure what it's doing, but it takes long enough for me to kill it and restart it.
This is a frustrating way to start a dog walk.

Instead, start the application early when you have a good connection,
or you have time to let it do whatever-it-is-doing.

# Summary

After almost 2.5 years, we're still enjoying having Findster as part of our walks.
The battery is good, the improved waterproofing (to nearly 1 metre) is great to have.

We've found a good way to secure the unit to the dog,
and learned that it's best to start the app when you're in an area of good reception.
