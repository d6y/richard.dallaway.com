A page to collect together various bash tricks I've needed.

# Recursive Search and Replace

Edit files in place, applying a simple search and replace:

    find [1,2]* -type f -exec sed -i.bak 's|foo|baz|' {} +

Note the `+` at the end, which allows `find` to pass multiple files to the command to be `exec`-ed.
This reduces the number of invocations of `sed`.

# Insert a line (if it's not there already)

The scenario: I have some YAML meta data on a blog post, and I want to insert a `permalink` key after the `author` key, but only if the file doesn't already have a `permalink` entry.

Solution:

    find . -type f ! -exec grep -q 'permalink:' {} \; -exec gawk -i inplace '/author:/ { print; print "permalink: /blog/:title"; next}1' {} \;

This requires GNU Awk for the in-place editing of a file.

# Batch Rename

Adding a prefix:

    for f in *.png; do mv "$f" "prefix-${f}"; done

Removing a prefix:

    or f in *.png; do mv "$f" "${f#prefix}"; done

# Stomp on the Content of a Set of Files

For example: you want to find ever `build.properties` file and set the content to be `sbt.version=1.0.1`:

    find . -name build.properties -exec bash -c 'echo "sbt.version=1.0.1" > {}' \;

Note the need to escape the echo command because otherwise the `>` part is executed early by Bash.

# Remove Recent Docker Container

This is handy if, for example, you're running a database in Docker, and you want to totally blow it away.

Solution:

Stop the docker container, and then go check for the ID:

    docker ps -a | head -2

That will give you the `CONTAINER ID` along with other useful sanity-checking information. E.g.,

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
    9b30fe9e0da6        postgres:latest                    "docker-entrypoint..."

Next, remove the container:

    docker rm 9b30fe9e0da6 

...or whatever the container id should be.

# Remove Multiple Docker Containers

You try to remove a Docker image but discover it's referenced by containers. You want to remove those containers.

Solution:

    docker ps -a | grep /book | awk '{print $1}' | xargs  docker rm

Here we're grep-ing for `/book` which happens to be an image name I'm interested in.
