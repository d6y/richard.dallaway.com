A page to collect together various bash tricks I've needed.

# Recursive Search and Replace

Edit files in place, applying a simple search and replace:

    find [1,2]* -type f -exec sed -i.bak 's|foo|baz|' {} +

Note the `+` at the end, which allows `find` to pass multiple files to the command to be `exec`-ed.
This reduces the number of invocations of `sed`.

# Insert a line (if it's not there already)

The scenario: I have some YAML meta data on a blog post, and I want to insert a `permalink` key after the `author` key, but only if the file doesn't already have a `permalink` entry.

Solution:

    find . -type f ! -exec grep -q 'permalink:' {} \; -exec gawk -i inplace '/author:/ { print; print "permalink: /blog/:title"; next}1' {} \;

This requires GNU Awk for the in-place editing of a file.
